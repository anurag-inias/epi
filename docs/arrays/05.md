# Delete duplicates from a sorted array

## Description

Given a sorted list, remove duplicates from it and return the new size.

## Example

```
 Input = [2 3 5 5  7 11 11 11 13]
Output = [2 3 4 7 11 13  0  0  0]
```

## Stub

```java
public static int deleteDuplicates(List<Integer> A) {
  // Fill here.
}
```

## Solution

    Simply maintain a $cursor$ for placing the next item. Only increment it if:

    1. it's the first element being processed.
    2. or current element is not same as $prev$, the previously seen element.

    ```java
    public static int deleteDuplicates(List<Integer> A) {
      int cursor = 0, count = 0;
      Integer prev = null;

      for (int n : A) {
        // First element or have not been seen before.
        if (prev == null || prev != n) {
          A.set(cursor++, n);
          count++;
        }
        prev = n;
      }
      return count;
    }
    ```
